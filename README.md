This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Express.js applications related to unhandled asynchronous errors within request handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of an Express application that simulates a scenario where a database error can occur within a timeout.  The error handling is incomplete, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a robust solution that handles such errors effectively.
